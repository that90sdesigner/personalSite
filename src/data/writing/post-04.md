I designed and built this website in early spring this year (March 2024) and one of the things I wanted from the beginning was a nice, modern font for the body text. At the time, I chose the excellent [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) from Google Fonts because it was free and it is easy to read in longform content. However, it was boring and lacked the modern look that I was going for with this website. 

Since then, I have been keeping an eye out for modern, stylish and simple fonts that can replace EB Garamond. Earlier this week, my eye caught something that I really like after someone on Mastodon posted a link to the Atipo foundry. Their fonts seem very practical and reasonably priced. 


## Safiro replaces EB Garamond
I am still using REM for the headlines, page titles and post titles, but for everything else including this post you are reading, I am now using [Safiro](https://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/safiro). A co-worker made me fall in love with grotesk fonts and this font instantly caught my eye. The feature I like the most is how the curves connect to the stem of the letters. This is apparent in the g, m and k among others. I also love the loop in the italicized _z_.

## My first time 
I have been a UX designer for a long time, but I have never purchased a font and put it to use in a project. So while this may be a small update, it is also a big first time type adventure for me. And as it always goes, type makes or breaks content. 

For now, I am very satisfied with the results and until some other font wins me over, Safiro will be here to style this website.

				 Hello! Welcome to my corner on the internet
			   </div>
				<div class="about">
						<p> I am glad you found my personal site. It's an <em>about me</em> page, blog, and portfolio rolled into one. It could be much more, but I have way more ideas than motivation to work on them (i.e., I'm a lazy human).</p>
<p>This site is a never-ending side project for me. It is also a place where I practice typesetting on the web. And since it's cool to have a blog, I write here sometimes (rarely).</p>

<p>When not day-dreaming at a coffee shop or hanging out with friends, I obsess over fonts, lettering compositions, <a href="https://yearinbooks.com">read books</a>, watch TV and cringe when someone uses display type for body text.</p>

<p style="text-wrap:pretty">Lastly, I'm a <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/shankarux">UI designer at a big company</a> working on an email app called Gmail. My job doesn't define me as a person, but I'm thankful for what I have. Again, thanks for visiting, but don't linger too long.</p>

<em>Scroll down, there is more stuff down there!</em>

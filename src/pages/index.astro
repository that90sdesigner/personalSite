			<p class="about">
				<span class="callout"> I am Shankar, an interaction designer on Gmail.</span> This website is my personal corner on the internet. I create simple interfaces for complex problems. Right now, I am into elevating my typography game and building things on the web. Outside of interface design, I spend my time watching too much TV and reading books. When I am not working or consuming media, I am hanging out with friends.
